    Definition

        Simple script to securely copy files from the local to a remote system
        as root even though SSH root login is not permitted.

    Details

        Usually, logging into a remote system using the root account via SSH
        is disabled on servers for security reasons. Instead, there is a
        separate user account to use for that purpose, e. g. 'johndoe'.

        Now, if you use that user in combination via rsync or scp, you can't
        copy files in the remote '/root' or '/etc' directory, due to the fact,
        that 'johndoe' does not have the permission to write to those
        locations.

        You could copy the files to '/tmp', however, you would have to change
        the owner on the remote system to have a consistent file ownership.

        This script allows to securely copy files to system directories on a
        remote system (like 'scp') with root as owner no matter which user is
        being used on the local system.

        As the name implies, it is a quick-and-dirty solution.
