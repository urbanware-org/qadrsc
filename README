    Definition

        Simple script to securely copy files from the local to a remote system
        as root even though SSH root login is not permitted.

    Details

        Usually, logging into a remote system using the root account via SSH
        is disabled on servers for security reasons. Instead, there is a
        separate user account to use for that purpose, e. g. "johndoe".

        Now, if you use that user in combination via 'rsync' or 'scp', you
        can't copy files in the remote '/root' or '/etc' directory, due to the
        fact, that "johndoe" does not have the permission to write to those
        locations.

        You could copy the files to '/tmp', however, you would have to change
        the owner on the remote system to have a consistent file ownership.

        This script allows to securely copy files to system directories on a
        remote system (like 'scp') with root as owner no matter which user is
        being used on the local system.

        As the name implies, it is a quick-and-dirty solution.

        Feel free to modify!

    Example

        The command-line arguments have been revised in version 1.1.0 of the
        project. From now on, you can use the typical 'rsync' or 'scp' syntax
        for the destination path.

        So, let's assume you have the server 192.168.2.1 which does not permit
        logging in via SSH as root, but with the user "johndoe".

        Now, you want to copy the local file '/etc/foobar.conf' to the '/etc'
        directory of the server. You can do that as follows:

            $ ./qadrsc.sh /etc/foobar.conf johndoe@192.168.2.1:/etc

        In the next step you want to copy the contents of '/tmp/somestuff'
        to '/root' on the remote system. Simply use the following command:

            $ ./qadrsc.sh '/etc/somestuff/*' johndoe@192.168.2.1:/root

        Notice that when using asterisks (*) in the source path, the path must
        either be enclosed with single (') or double (") quotes. Otherwise an
        argument error (too many arguments) will occur.

        Using a dynamic path also works, e. g.:

            $ cd /etc
            $ $ ./qadrsc.sh ./foobar.conf johndoe@192.168.2.1:/etc
