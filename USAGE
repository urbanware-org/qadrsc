    1. Definition
    
        Simple script to securely copy files from the local to a remote system
        as root even though SSH root login is not permitted.       
        
    2. General
    
        The script requires command-line arguments to operate. You can get an
        overview of all arguments available, by simply running the script with
        with the '--help' argument:

                $ ./qadrsc.sh --help

    3. Preparation
    
        Before you can use the script, you have to prepare the remote system.
        
        Create a user which you want to use for the remote interaction, e. g.
        'johndoe'.
               
            # useradd johndoe
                
        Set a password for the new user.
            
            # passwd johndoe
                   
        Run 'visudo' and add the following line at the end of the file:

            johndoe     ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: ALL
                   
        Save the changes and exit.

    4. Usage
    
        The command-line arguments have been revised in version 1.1.0 of the
        project. From now on, you can use the typical 'rsync' or 'scp' syntax
        for the destination path.

        Notice that when using asterisks (*) in the source path, the whole
        path must either be enclosed with single (') or double (") quotes.
        Otherwise an argument error will occur (too many arguments).
        
        4.1 Examples with remote destinations
        
            4.1.1 Absolute source path
            
                So, let's assume you have the server with the IP address
                192.168.2.1 which does not permit logging in via SSH as root,
                but with the user 'johndoe'.

                Now, you want to copy the local file '/etc/foobar.conf' to the
                '/etc' directory of the server. You can do that as follows:

                    $ ./qadrsc.sh /etc/foobar.conf johndoe@192.168.2.1:/etc

                In the next step you want to copy the contents of '/tmp/stuff'
                to '/root' on the remote system. Simply use the following
                command:

                    $ ./qadrsc.sh '/tmp/stuff/*' johndoe@192.168.2.1:/root

                You can also copy the entire directory:

                    $ ./qadrsc.sh /tmp/stuff johndoe@192.168.2.1:/root
            
            4.1.2 Relative source path
            
                Using a relative path also works. In the following example the
                the directory '/tmp/stuff' will be copied to the remote server
                into the '/root' directory (assuming that 'qadrsc.sh' script
                is located in '/opt/qadrsc').

                    $ cd /tmp
                    $ /opt/qadrsc/qadrsc.sh ./stuff johndoe@192.168.2.1:/root

        4.2 Example with a remote source
        
            Since version 1.2.0 you can also use a remote path as source, for
            example:

                $ ./qadrsc.sh johndoe@192.168.2.1:/etc/foobar.conf /tmp
        
        4.3 Bash alias
      
            In order to simplify and speed up the use of the script, you can
            add a Bash alias to '/etc/bashrc' (system wide) or '~/.bashrc'
            (for the current user).

                alias qadrsc='/opt/qadrsc/qadrsc.sh'
